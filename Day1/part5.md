**Real Life Objects, Properties, and Methods**\
> + In real life, a car is an object.
> + A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop:
> + All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.
> + All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.
> + Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
> + This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to a variable named car:
