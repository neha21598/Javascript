# Advantages of JavaScript
**Speed**
> +  Since JavaScript is an ‘interpreted’ language, it reduces the time required by other programming languages like Java for compilation.
>  + JavaScript is also a client-side script, speeding up the execution of the program as it saves the time required to connect to the server.

**Simplicity**
> + JavaScript is easy to understand and learn. 
> + The structure is simple for the users as well as the developers.

**Popularity**
> + Since all modern browsers support JavaScript, it is seen almost everywhere.
> +  All the famous companies use JavaScript as a tool including Google, Amazon, PayPal, etc.

**Interoperability**
> + JavaScript works perfect with other programming languages and therefore numerous developers prefer it in developing many applications. 
> + We can embed it into any webpage or inside the script of another programming language.

**Server Load**
> + As JavaScript operates on the client-side, data validation is possible on the browser itself rather than sending it off to the server.
> +  In case of any discrepancy, the whole website needs not to be reloaded. The browser updates only the selected segment of the page.


**Rich Interfaces**
> + JavaScript provides various interfaces to developers for creating catchy webpages.
> +  Drag and drop components or sliders may give a rich interface to the webpages.
> +  This leads to improved user-interactivity on the webpage.

**Less Overhead**
> + JavaScript improves the performance of websites and web applications by reducing the code length. 
> + The codes contain less overhead with the use of various built-in functions for loops, DOM access, etc.

**Less server interaction**
> + You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server.
> +  This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.
	
**Immediate feedback to the visitors**
> +  They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.

**Increased interactivity**
> +  You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.
